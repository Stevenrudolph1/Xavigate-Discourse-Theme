### Permission Status - Activated- Account has a verified email and is therefore active in the Discourse instance
Account may login to Discourse, inactive accounts may not login
Inactive accounts can only verify their email (and other routes as necessary to complete registration).
Storage: active boolean column in the users table

### Staged
A special placeholder account which is created automatically by the system for email integration
No email digests are ever sent
Automatically watches all messages it participates in and receives notifications of replies
May reply via email to notifications
Username and Name are automatically picked
Account may still register with the same email and “take over” the staged account.
